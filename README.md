# SparePartsPricePredictionApp

<b>Abstract</b></br>
There are more than 50% of the people are driving vehicles in Sri Lanka. All drivers face many vehicle-related troubles like vehicle breakdown, maintenance issues, high cost, and vehicle insurance issues in day to day life. It is hard to manage all the things at once. More than 80% of the drivers have less knowledge about vehicle-related things. Someone has the ability to fix these problems but most of the drivers are unable to face these problems by themselves. They hope for help from someone. Because of that many drivers are motivated to use mobile applications. By using those mobile applications they can find immediate solutions for their vehicle problems and can efficiently do their daily works. But still, most of these mobile applications and other online features focus primarily on only one or two features. There is no specific app that has all the features in it. Our proposed mobile application will help the user to find solutions in the vehicle breakdown, provide maintenance details for vehicle safety, reduce the unnecessary cost for repairs and also provide a good recommendation about the vehicle insurance companies.
